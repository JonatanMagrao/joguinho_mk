<p>This is a simple project concept I created for the sake of my knowledge in Object Orientation in Js Vanilla.</p>
<p>The idea came when I was playing a ipad game at night. There was a war game, with tank and plane levels, I thought then it should be made with Objects and Classes
to create the levels.</p>
<p>I started then to coding and realized it was kinda simple to make the characters in classes and make then fighting each other.</p>
<>The project it's simple, the idea wasn't make it beautiful or even playfull, just for practice. I commited it here because I'll keep trying to make it better:
the css is still weak and I could add some more functionalities in the game.
</p>
<p>Advice: I do now own the rights of the characters of the game or even your name. The purpose was only to practice programming. The game was used just as inspiration to me.</p>
